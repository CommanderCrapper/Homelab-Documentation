SUMMARY
-------------
Started in 2025, this repo is dedicated to the homelab I run at home, used for personal projects & learning.

Very much a WIP, there are a lot of projects I have in mind that I will be working on in the future, listed below:

FUTURE GOALS
-------------
- Actually proper documentation (readthedocs.io most likely) with bug fixes I've encountered, examples of hosted projects, etc.
- Port-forwarding (with firewall)
- Fully interactable network of devices I can interact with remotely under the subnet (that's privately hosted, not owned by a bigger corporation)
- 2FA for extra security measures, especially for if port-forwarding will be implemented
- Experimentation with AI natively once the homelab is able to handle LLMs (for learning how AIs work & pentesting)
- Upgraded hardware for the homelab
- Open air build (if possible)
- Server rack with multiple servers & services running all at once
- Website hosting with my own online portfolio (like the one currently on my Github profile, although more professional & tidied up)
- Experimentation with network switches & other general-purpose server management devices
- Customization of the homelab's exterior (the case) with stickers & other various features
- Labeling of wires & hardware once there are enough to be considered confusing or conflicting
