SUMMARY
-------------
Started in 2025, this repository is dedicated to the homelab I run at home, used for personal projects & learning.

I will update this page as often as I can, however with college & life, it would be wise not to expect very frequent/major updates. The homelab & it's documentation are still very much a work in progress, as there are a lot of projects I have in mind that I will be working on in the future, listed below:

FUTURE GOALS
-------------
- Actually proper documentation (readthedocs.io most likely) with bug fixes I've encountered, examples of hosted projects, etc.
- Port-forwarding (with firewall)
- Fully interactable network of devices I can interact with remotely under the subnet (that's privately hosted, not owned by a bigger corporation)
- 2FA for extra security measures, especially for if port-forwarding will be implemented
- Experimentation with AI natively once the homelab is able to handle LLMs (for learning how AIs work & pentesting)
- Upgraded hardware for the homelab
- Open air build (if possible)
- Server rack with multiple servers & services running all at once
- Website hosting with my own online portfolio (like the one currently on my Github profile, although more professional & tidied up)
- Experimentation with network switches & other general-purpose server management devices
- Customization of the homelab's exterior (the case) with stickers & other various features
- Labeling of wires & hardware once there are enough to be considered confusing or conflicting

CREDITS
-------------
A majority of anything I've done couldn't have been without the assistance & encouragement of the friends & professors I've learned from, engaged with, & have come to know throughout the years of me taking an interest in computer science & cybersecurity. I am eternally grateful for all the opportunities I've been given & all the people I've come to know that have encouraged me to push myself forward.
