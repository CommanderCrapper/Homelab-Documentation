Started in 2025, this repo is dedicated to the homelab I run at home, used for personal projects & learning.

Hoping to eventually expand this into a more proper documentation, i.e. readthedocs.io, with bug fixes I've found along my journey & actual demos of the services I run in the future.

FUTURE GOALS
-------------
- Properly port forwarding (with firewall)
- Fully interactable network of devices I can interact with remotely under the subnet (that's privately hosted, not owned by a bigger corporation)
-
